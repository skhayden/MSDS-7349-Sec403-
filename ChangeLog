	* fcrypt.py (crypt): Add note to doc string about lack of support
	for _, $1$, $2$ from some C libraries' crypt functions.  Rewrite
	salt parsing and password encoding for greater clarity.

	* setup.py: Add more fields for PyPI.

	* README: Add note about lack of support for _, $1$, $2$, etc.,
	and about FutureWarnings in Python 2.3.

	* fcrypt.py: Add module doc string for pydoc, and other globals
	for pydoc as well.  Add __all__ for Python 2.1, and add
	underscores to the front of private variables and functions.
	(_set_key): Remove overly clever copying of globals into default
	parameters, explicitly copying _shift2 and _skb before the loop.
	(_body): Copy _SPtrans explicitly, as above.  Remove CR_ENCRYPT
	inline function, and reroll unrolled loop using the contents of
	this function.  Result: more readable code, and a 400% speedup!
	(crypt): Add doc string for pydoc and doctest.
	(_test): New function for doctest.

	* setup.py: Add fields for PKG-INFO metadata.

	* README: Add URL of distutils installation manual.

	* LICENSE: Add note about license on fcrypt.py being the union of
	my license on the Python code and Eric Young's on the original C.
